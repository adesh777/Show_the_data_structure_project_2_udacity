# BlockChain Explanation
# Time and Space Complexity
#Time complexity
The complexity of the algorithm is basically constant since the operations are appending to the tail of the double linked list, 
and accessing previous hash of a node.
# Space complexity
The space complexity of the algorithm is linear i.e. O(n), where n is size of the blockchain.
